# Holy Cross Hospital Chain Performance Dashboard (2019–2024)

## Introduction:
This dashboard presents a multi-dimensional performance analysis of the Holy Cross Hospital Chain over a six-year period. Using visual analytics, the dashboard provides an overview of patient demographics, insurance revenue, hospital performance, medication distribution, and year-on-year revenue trends. The objective is to identify critical insights that can inform future planning, resource allocation, and operational improvements within the hospital chain.

## Insights and Observations
### 1. Patient Admission Revenue Trend:
* The hospital witnessed steady revenue growth from 2019 (£189M) to a peak in 2020 (£286.5M), followed by a plateau through 2023.
* A sharp decline was recorded in 2024 to £207.8M, indicating a possible external factor affecting revenue generation.
### 2. Insurance Provider Performance:
* Cigna emerged as the highest contributor to insurance revenue (£287M), followed closely by Medicare (£285.7M).
* Blue Cross contributed the least among the top three with £283.2M.
### 3. Patient Intake by Category:
* Elective cases had the highest intake (18,655), slightly ahead of Emergency (18,576) and Urgent (18,269).
* This shows balanced resource demands across departments, but suggests elective care may be prioritized
### 4. Top-Performing Hospitals:
* Johnson Plc generated the highest revenue (£1.08M), indicating operational efficiency or higher patient volume.
* Other Smith-affiliated hospitals also performed well, highlighting strong internal consistency across facilities.
### Medication Revenue Performance:
	•	Ibuprofen led as the highest revenue-generating medication (£286.3M), followed by Aspirin (£283.9M) and Paracetamol (£282.6M).
	•	These drugs are also among the most frequently prescribed, reflecting high demand for common over-the-counter medications.
	6.	Prescription Trends by Age:
	•	Lipitor was the most prescribed medication by age group (11,140), highlighting its widespread usage for cholesterol management across age brackets.
	7.	Blood Group Distribution:
	•	A+, A−, AB+, B+, and AB− blood groups showed nearly identical individual counts (~6945–6969), indicating a fairly even population distribution by blood type.

✅ Recommendations

	1.	Investigate the Revenue Decline in 2024:
	•	A 2024 drop in annual revenue suggests a need to assess external challenges (e.g., policy changes, economic factors, or pandemics). Stakeholders should conduct a root cause analysis.
	2.	Strengthen Insurance Partnerships:
	•	With Cigna and Medicare performing strongly, strategic alliances can be built around these providers to expand patient reach and improve service delivery.
 3.	Optimize Elective Services:
	•	Since elective cases are the highest, improving efficiency and patient turnaround in this area can increase revenue and satisfaction.
	4.	Medication Inventory Management:
	•	The high revenue generated by Ibuprofen and Lipitor calls for careful inventory and supply chain monitoring to meet continued demand.
	5.	Targeted Health Programs:
	•	The age-based prescription data suggests a need for targeted programs addressing cholesterol and pain management among middle-aged and older adults.
	6.	Maintain Consistency Across Hospital Branches:
	•	With Smith hospitals consistently ranking in the top 5, cross-learning and standardization across branches could help uplift underperforming units.
